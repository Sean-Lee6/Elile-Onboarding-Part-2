# Elile-Onboarding-Part-2

The original work is based on "Short-term Memory Solar Energy Forecasting at University of Illinois"
by Adele Kuzmiakova, Gael Colas, Alex McKeehan in Stanford University during December 2017. 

Read the "Elile_Part_2_Write_Up.pdf" file for my additions to the project. The "rnn.py" file contains the original LSTM model. The "rnn_new.py" file contains the LSTM model trained on sequential data and a different split. The "rnn_new_lag.py" file contains the LSTM model trained on sequential data and contains additional lag features. The mse text files contain the mean squared errors of each LSTM model. 


The prediction csv files are the LSTM models' predicted outputs. These values are normalized.
